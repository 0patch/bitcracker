Bitcracker
========

BitCracker is the first open source BitLocker password cracker tool

Introduction
===

BitLocker is a full-disk encryption feature available in recent Windows versions (Vista, 7, 8.1 and 10) Pro and Enterprise.
BitCracker is a mono-GPU password cracking tool for memory units encrypted with the password authentication mode of BitLocker (see picture below).

Our attack has been tested on several memory units encrypted with BitLocker running on Windows 7, Window 8.1 and Windows 10 (both compatible and non-compatible mode).
here we present two implementations: CUDA and OpenCL.

Requirements
===

For CUDA implementation, you need at least CUDA 7.5 and an NVIDIA GPU with minimum cc3.5 (i.e. Kepler arch) 

How To
===

Use the buil.sh script to run makefiles within CUDA_version and OpenCL_version.

```
> ./bitcracker_cuda -h

Usage: ./bitcracker_cuda -i <disk_image> -d <dictionary_file>

Options:

  -h, --help				Show this help
  -i, --diskimage			Path to your disk image
  -d, --dictionary file		Path to dictionary or alphabet file
  -g, --gpu					GPU device number
  -t, --passthread			Set the number of password per thread threads
  -b, --blocks				Set the number of blocks
```

You can use the run.sh script to execute two simple runs using the encrypted images we provide in this repo:
* imgWin8: memory unit encrypted with BitLocker using a Windows 8 Enteprise edition OS
* imgWin7: memory unit encrypted with BitLocker using a Windows 7 Enteprise edition OS

Currently, BitCracker is able to evaluate passwords having length  between 8 (minimum password length) and 16 characters (implementation reasons). We will increase the max passwords size in the next release.
BitCracker doesn't provide any mask attack, cache mechanism or smart dictionary creation; thus you need to provide your own input dictionary.

We released the OpenCL version as a plugin of the John The Ripper (bleeding jumbo) suite.
