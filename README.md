# BitCracker

BitCracker is the first open source password cracking tool for memory units (Hard Disk, USB Pendrive, SD card, etc...) encrypted with [BitLocker](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc766295(v=ws.10).aspx), an encryption feature available on Windows Vista, 7, 8.1 and 10 (Ultimate, Pro, Enterprise editions).
BitCracker is a mono-GPU algorithm (implemented in [CUDA](http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda) and [OpenCL](https://www.khronos.org/opencl) ) which performs a dictionary attack against memory units encrypted with BitLocker.
For all the authentication (encryption) methods offered by BitLocker (i.e. User Password, Smart Card, TPM, TPM+PIN, etc..) you can always use the BitCracker Recovery Password attack (-r option). As additional feature, if your device has been encrypted with an User Password (BitLocker-To-Go feature) you can use the BitCracker User Password attack (-u option). 

**CRITICAL ERROR FIXED IN COMMITS 7b2a6b6 (CUDA version) and 5f09d7f (OpenCL version): bad loop termination! Please re-run your tests.**

## User Password Attack

With this authentication method, the user can choose to encrypt a memory device by means of a password.

![alt text](http://openwall.info/wiki/_media/john/bitcracker_img1.png)

To find the password used during the encryption with BitCracker, you need to specify the -u option (see the *How To* section).

## Recovery Password Attack

During the encryption of a memory device, (regardless the authentication method) BitLocker asks the user to store somewhere a Recovery Password that can be used to restore the access to the encrypted memory unit in the event that she/he can't unlock the drive normally.
Thus the Recovery Password is a kind of *passe-partout* for all the authentication methods and it consists of a 48-digit key like this:

> 236808-089419-192665-495704-618299-073414-538373-542366

To find the correct Recovery Password with BitCracker, you need to specify the -r option (see *How To* section).
See [Microsoft docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/device-security/bitlocker/bitlocker-recovery-guide-plan) for further details.

## Requirements

Minimum requirements for CUDA implementation:

- CUDA 7.5
- [NVIDIA GPU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nvidia_graphics_processing_units) with CC 3.5 or later

As shown in the *Performance* section, both CUDA and OpenCL implementations have been tested on several NVIDIA GPUs with *Kepler*, *Maxwell* and *Pascal* architectures. In addition, the OpenCL code has been tested on an AMD GPU and a 2.9 GHz Intel Core i7 CPU (quad-core).

Minimum memory requirement is 260 Mb; it may increase depending on the number of passwords processed by each kernel.

## How To

Use the *build.sh* script to build 3 executables:

- bitcracker_hash
- bitcracker_cuda
- bitcracker_opencl

The script stores the executables in the *build* local directory.

You need to configure the src_CUDA/Makefile and src_OpenCL/Makefile according to your CUDA/GPU/Platform type or version.
To compile the bitcracker_cuda, please use the following correspondence table:

| GPU Architecture | Suggested CUDA |         NVCC Gencode       |
| ---------------- | -------------- | -------------------------- |
| Kepler           | CUDA 7.5       | arch=compute_35,code=sm_35 |
| Maxwell          | CUDA 8.0       | arch=compute_52,code=sm_52 |
| Pascal           | CUDA 9.0       | arch=compute_60,code=sm_60 |
| Volta            | CUDA 9.0       | arch=compute_70,code=sm_70 |


#### Step 1: Extract the image

You need to extract the image of your memory device encrypted with BitLocker.
For example, you can use the *dd* command:

```
sudo dd if=/dev/disk2 of=/path/to/imageEncrypted conv=noerror,sync
4030464+0 records in
4030464+0 records out
2063597568 bytes transferred in 292.749849 secs (7049013 bytes/sec)
```

#### Step 2: Extract the hash

*bitcracker_hash* verifies if the input memory unit satisfies some requirements. It returns two output files:

* hash_user_pass.txt : the hash you need to start the User Password attack mode
* hash_recv_pass.txt : the hash you need to start the Recovery Password attack mode

```
/build/bitcracker_hash -o test_hash -i ./Images/imgWin7

Output file for user password attack: "hash_user_pass.txt"
Output file for recovery password attack: "hash_recv_pass.txt"
```

Notes:
- While the *hash_recv_pass.txt* should be always created, the *hash_user_pass.txt* is created only if the input device has been encrypted with the User Password authentication method.
- **BDE encrypted volumes could have different structure for different authentication methods. If *bitcracker_hash* is not able to find the Recovery Password on your encrypted image, please open an issue or contact me**

#### Step 3: Start the attack

Now you can start the BitCracker attack; use the *-h* to see all the options. Here there is an attack example using the User Password method.

```

## Limitations

The Recovery Password attack has been tested only with devices encrypted using the User Password; **if you test this attack mode with devices encrypted using a Smart Card or TPM, please give us your feedback!**

BitCracker doesn't provide any mask attack, cache mechanism or smart dictionary creation; therefore you need to create your own input dictionary.

Currently, the User Password attack allows input passwords with a length between 8 and 55 characters.

## False Positives

By default, BitCracker runs a fast attack (both User and Recovery password) and it can return some false positive. To avoid false positives you can use 2 options:

* -s : enables an additional check (no time consuming). This option could return some false negative
* -m : enables the MAC verification. With this option there aren't false positives or negatives but performance decreases a lot; use this options only in case of an input wordlist composed by false positives.

## Examples

In the the *run_test.sh* script there are several examples of attack using the images and dictionaries of this repo:

* imgWin7: BitLocker on Windows 7 Enteprise edition OS
* imgWin8: BitLocker on Windows 8 Enteprise edition OS
* imgWin10Compat.vhd: BitLocker (compatible mode) on Windows 10 Pro edition OS
* imgWin10NotCompat.vhd: BitLocker (not compatible mode) on Windows 10 Pro edition OS

## Performance

Here we report the best BitCracker performances in case of fast attack (default) to the User Password (-u option).

## John The Ripper

We released BitCracker as the [OpenCL-BitLocker](http://openwall.info/wiki/john/OpenCL-BitLocker) format in [John The Ripper](https://github.com/magnumripper/JohnTheRipper) (`--format=bitlocker-opencl`).
The hash files generated by `bitcracker_hash` (see *How To* section) are fully compatible with the John format.<br>
On the GTV100 password rate is about 3150p/s. JtR team developed the CPU version of this attack (`--format=bitlocker`); on a CPU Intel(R) Xeon(R) v4 2.20GHz, password rate is about 78p/s.

## Changelog

06/14 : User Password attack mode now supports passwords length up to 55

#### Next Release

* Provide a dictionary with all the possible Recovery Passwords (they are not randomly generated!)
* Provide a multi-GPU implementation
